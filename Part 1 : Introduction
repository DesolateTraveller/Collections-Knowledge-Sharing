Data Science Data Science (a.k.a. Data Mining) is about explaining the past and predicting the future by means of data analysis.  Data science is a multi-disciplinary field which combines statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and database technology. The value of data science applications is often estimated to be very high. Many businesses have stored large amounts of data over years of operation, and data science is able to extract very valuable knowledge from this data. The businesses are then able to leverage the extracted knowledge into more clients, more sales, and greater profits. This is also true in the engineering and medical fields
